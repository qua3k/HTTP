# HTTP

[HTTP](https://github.com/qua3k/HTTP) is an extension that is meant to upgrade requests to HTTPS using the `declarativeNetRequest` API.

Will be obsoleted by [HTTPS-only mode](https://blog.chromium.org/2021/07/increasing-https-adoption.html).

## Why?

This extension was conceived out of a need for extensions that used the new `declarativeNetRequest` and aimed to have little attack surface.

[Version 2](https://github.com/qua3k/HTTP/tree/v2) of HTTP allows users to manually add sites to a session allowlist. Users that do not have a need for allowlisting should opt to install [version 1](https://github.com/qua3k/HTTP/tree/v1) of HTTP.
