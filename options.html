        <h1>HTTP</h1>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/qua3k/HTTP/">HTTP</a> is an extension that is meant to upgrade requests to HTTPS using the <code>declarativeNetRequest</code> API.</p>
        <p>Will be obsoleted by <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/07/increasing-https-adoption.html">HTTPS-only mode</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="why">Why? <a class="anchor" href="#why">#</a></h1>
        <p>This extension was conceived out of a need for extensions that used the new <code>declarativeNetRequest</code> and aimed to have little attack surface.</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/qua3k/HTTP/tree/v2">Version 2</a> of HTTP allows users to manually add sites to a session allowlist. Users that do not have a need for allowlisting should opt to install <a href="https://github.com/qua3k/HTTP/tree/v1">version 1</a> of HTTP.</p>
        <p><a href="/allowlist.html">See allowlist...</a></p>
